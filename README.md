# Arcade Game Clone Project

## Instructions

Welcome to the game!! :smile: 

Just load the `index.html` file in your favorite browser and make sure you have the `images` folder. Or simply click [this link](https://gkm1257.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/). Then you are good to go!

First select the character you like with left and right arrow keys, then press the start button to start the game. 

The goal of you player is trying to reach the `water`(1st row) without colliding any `enemy`(bug). Only the up, down, left and right arrow keys are allowed to use to move the player around. 

Once you collide with an `enemy`, you will die immediately. And the whole game starts from the beginning again.

If you win the game, feel free to press the `replay` button to play again!!
